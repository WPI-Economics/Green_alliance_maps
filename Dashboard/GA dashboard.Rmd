#### Background

In 2021, Green Alliance commissioned WPI Economics to research the link between restoring nature and levelling up. Their analysis calculates a labour market challenge score for each constituency and finds that those with the greatest challenges also have the greatest potential for nature restoration.

Information {data-orientation=rows data-icon="fa-info-circle"}
===================================== 

### Definitions 

#### Labour market challenge score
An index where 100 reflects the average constituency. It is constructed from four measures: underemployment before the pandemic; the increase in underemployment in the year to September 2020; the proportion of the working age population on furlough and SEISS in January 2021; forecast change in employment based on sectoral risk.

#### Seagrass points
Current and historic known seagrass meadows. This is where restoration is most likely needed but it is likely an underestimate. Seagrass locations were estimated by WPI Economics from named locations provided in [Green at al (2021)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.629962/full) but may not represent exact locations.

#### Coastal restoration
Potential sites for new coastal habitats, identified by the RSPB Sustainable Shores project.

#### Great North Bog
Outline of the Great North Bog proposal, a peatland restoration initiative being developed by the North Pennines AONB partnership, the Yorkshire Peat Partnership and the Moors for the Future partnership. There is no comprehensive, national mapping of peatland potential currently in the public domain, though the Great North Bog contains 92% of Englandâ€™s upland peat.

#### High woodland potential
The constituencies with the highest potential for new woodland, with at least 18,500 hectares per constituency. Potential woodland sites were identified by the RSPB, avoiding carbon rich soils, important non-woodland habitats, nature conservation sites, highly productive farmland and towns and cities.

All further methodology and sources can be found in the [full report](https://green-alliance.org.uk/)

### How to use this app

#### Filters

You can:

* Select one or more constituencies from the dropdown menu (remove them with your backspace key)
* Filter the table from the spaces under the column headings
* Filter the table using the map selection tool

#### Interactive map

You can:

* click to grab and drag the map around
* zoom with the '+' and '--' buttons (top-left) or with your mouse's scroll wheel
* click an area to reveal a popup with information about that constituency
* click the button showing a broken square (top-left under the zoom options) to select points on the map using a window that's draggable (click and hold the grid icon in the upper left) and resizeable (click and drag the white boxes in each corner)

#### Interactive table

You can:

* filter each column by typing in the boxes under each column header
* sort the columns (ascending and descending) by clicking on the column header
* change which columns are visible by clicking the Column visibility button
* click 'CSV' or 'Excel' to download the filtered data to a .csv file or a .xlsx
* see how many entries remain after filtering in the bottom-left, where it says 'Showing X to Y of Z entries'
